(name 'MicroKanren-AdolfoPerezAlvarez.2' message 'Add conses and full unification implementationThis version finishes the implementation of unification. Now MicroKanren fully supports three kinds of elements:  - Variables, that act as placeholders for values. Will unify with elements of any kind.  - Conses, the only compound object supported by MicroKanren, unifies with variables and other conses.  - Objects, an arbitrary Pharo object (with the exception of vars and conses). Unify with variables and other objects (only if equal).' id 'f5d4cc29-2ad2-49d5-a5c7-4c45db8925f2' date '19 January 2015' time '11:26:53.116528 pm' author 'AdolfoPerezAlvarez' ancestors ((name 'MicroKanren-AdolfoPerezAlvarez.1' message 'Implement unification of variables and atomic objects. ' id '906526b8-226b-4871-b5ef-6c9a7c6c5b9f' date '18 January 2015' time '4:24:09.219532 pm' author 'AdolfoPerezAlvarez' ancestors () stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())
